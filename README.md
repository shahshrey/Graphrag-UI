### Graph RAG Advantages

RAY incorporates Graph RAG, a superior technique for retrieval that offers several benefits over traditional RAG:

- **Enhanced context understanding**: Graph RAG leverages knowledge graphs to capture complex relationships between entities, providing more accurate and contextually rich answers.
- **Improved handling of structured and unstructured data**: It excels at representing and retrieving heterogeneous and interconnected information.
- **Better performance in domain-specific queries**: Graph RAG addresses limitations of generic embedding models in company-specific knowledge retrieval.

## 🚀 Quick Start ⌨️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shahshrey/ray-ai-assistant.git
   cd ray_ai_assistant
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
   - Fill in your API keys and other configuration values

5. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501)

7. Use the sidebar to configure RAY and upload your documents

8. Ask questions and interact with RAY through the main interface, leveraging both Graph RAG and traditional RAG capabilities for comprehensive information retrieval
