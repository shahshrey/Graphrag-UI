## 3. Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Step-by-step Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
   ```

   source graphragui_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: graphragui_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up Environment Variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
   GRAPHRAG_API_KEY=<your_graphrag_api_key>
   GRAPHRAG_LLM_MODEL=<preferred_llm_model>

   ```

5. Initialize the Knowledge Base:
   ```
   python -m graphrag.index --init --root brain
   ```

6. Run the Application:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

### Streamlit Interface Configuration

```9:34:src/ui/ui.py
def setup_sidebar():
    st.sidebar.title("graphragUI Configuration")
    tabs = st.sidebar.tabs(["Input", "Model", "Search", "Advanced"])
    with tabs[0]:  # Input tab
        user_input = st.text_area("Ask graphragUI a question (or multiple questions, one per line):")
        mode = st.selectbox("Select Search Mode", ["global", "local", "vanilla"], help="Global: Broad knowledge. Local: Specific context. Vanilla: Basic RAG.")
        st.subheader("Manage graphragUI's Knowledge")
        
        manage_input_files()
    
    with tabs[1]:  # Model tab
        config = {}
        config["openai_model"] = st.selectbox("Select graphragUI's Language Model", ["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini"], index=1)
        config["api_key"] = st.text_input("OpenAI API Key for graphragUI", value=API_KEY, type="password")
        config["temperature"] = st.slider("graphragUI's Creativity (Temperature)", min_value=0.0, max_value=1.0, value=0.0, step=0.1)
    
    with tabs[2]:  # Search tab
        config["allow_general_knowledge"] = st.checkbox("Allow graphragUI to Use General Knowledge", value=False)
        config["use_community_summary"] = st.checkbox("Use Community Summary in graphragUI's Responses", value=False)
        config["include_community_rank"] = st.checkbox("Include Community Rank in graphragUI's Analysis", value=True)
        config["community_level"] = st.slider("graphragUI's Community Analysis Depth", min_value=0, max_value=5, value=2, step=1)
    
    with tabs[3]:  # Advanced tab
        config["artifacts_dir"] = st.text_input("graphragUI's Knowledge Base Directory", value=ARTIFACTS_DIR)
    
    return user_input, mode, config
```


These options allow users to customize various aspects of graphragUI's behavior directly from the UI.

## 6. Usage Guide

### 6.1 Adding Documents to graphragUI's Knowledge Base

1. Navigate to the "Input" tab in the sidebar.
2. Use the file uploader to add new documents (supported formats: TXT, PDF, DOCX, PPTX, CSV).
3. Once uploaded, click on "Update graphragUI's Knowledge Base" to index the new documents.

### 6.2 Configuring Search Parameters

   - Select the preferred language model
   - Adjust the temperature (creativity) of the model
2. In the "Search" tab:
   - Toggle general knowledge usage
   - Enable/disable community summary and rank
   - Adjust the community analysis depth

### 6.3 Performing Searches

2. Select the search mode (global, local, or vanilla).
3. Click the "Submit" button to process your query.
4. View the results in the main area, which will include:
   - The AI's response
   - Token usage
   - Number of LLM calls

### 6.4 Managing the Knowledge Base

1. In the "Input" tab, you can:
   - View existing files in the knowledge base
   - Remove files from the knowledge base
   - Add new files to the knowledge base
2. After any changes, remember to update the knowledge base by clicking the appropriate button.

## 7. Advanced Features

### 7.1 Global vs. Local Search

- Global Search: Provides broad knowledge across the entire dataset.
- Local Search: Focuses on specific context, useful for detailed queries about particular topics.

### 7.2 Community Analysis

graphragUI uses a community-based analysis system to rank and weight information. This can be adjusted using the "Community Analysis Depth" slider in the UI.

### 7.3 Custom Indexing

For advanced users, custom indexing can be performed by modifying the indexing process in:


```15:19:src/indexing/indexing.py
def perform_indexing():
    st.info("Updating graphragUI's knowledge base...")
    subprocess.run(["python", "-m", "graphrag.index", "--root", BASE_DIR], check=True)
    st.success("graphragUI's knowledge base has been successfully updated!")
    st.experimental_rerun()
```


## 8. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **API Key Errors**: 
   - Ensure that your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file.
   - Check if the keys are valid and have the necessary permissions.

2. **Indexing Failures**:
   - Verify that the input files are in the correct format and not corrupted.
   - Check the console for specific error messages.
   - Ensure you have sufficient disk space for indexing.

3. **Out of Memory Errors**:
   - Try reducing the `CHUNK_SIZE` and `MAX_TOKENS` values in `src/config/config.py`.
   - Process smaller batches of documents at a time.

4. **Slow Performance**:
   - Adjust the `CONCURRENT_COROUTINES` value in `src/config/config.py`.
   - Consider upgrading your hardware or using a more powerful cloud instance.

### Logging

To enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

1. Modify `main.py` to include logging configuration:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename='graphragui_debug.log')
   ```

2. Add logging statements in relevant parts of the code, e.g.:
   ```python
   logging.debug(f"Processing query: {query}")
   ```

3. Check the `graphragui_debug.log` file for detailed information when issues occur.
